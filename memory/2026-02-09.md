## 20:34 - Important Lesson: Skills First! 🛠️

**User feedback:** "Always check your skills first before trying to do it yourself!"

**Context:** I manually tried to implement Venice AI video generation with curl/python instead of using the existing `venice-ai-media` skill.

**Lesson learned:**
- ALWAYS scan available skills BEFORE implementing something manually
- Skills are tested, maintained, and handle edge cases better
- Updated AGENTS.md with "Skills First" section

**Action taken:** Added permanent reminder in AGENTS.md workflow.

This is a core operating principle - skills exist for a reason. Use them!
